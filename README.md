# Reports and Presentations

This repo houses a few miscellaneous reports, projects and presentations that I've made.

License is MIT, except for a few things which I've attributed in the corresponding pdfs.

The projects are as follows:

1. Spectral graph theory project: my final year university project.
2. Spectral graph theory presentation: the presentation for the above.
3. HTTP/2 eval: a project I made in my second last year of high school evaluating the effectiveness of HTTP/2.
