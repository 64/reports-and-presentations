HTTP/2 is a new protocol that defines how web browsers communicate with websites. Standardised in 2015, it is a major revision of the widely used HTTP/1.1 protocol. In this project I will be exploring the advantages of using HTTP/2 over HTTP/1.1, such as faster page load times, bandwidth savings through improved encoding, and stricter security requirements. To investigate these improvements I have written a minimal web server that uses HTTP/2 and I report my findings on the performance of HTTP/2 compared to a commercial-grade HTTP/1.1 server. I also compare HTTP/2 to some competing protocols, concluding that HTTP/2 is advantageous enough that websites can only benefit from supporting it.
