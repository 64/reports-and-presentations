\section{Why does performance matter?}

For companies like Google, who are estimated to service 40 million requests per second~\cite{googlerequests}, small delays can incur very large costs. In 2006, they found that a delay of half a second on their search engine caused traffic and revenue from affected users to drop by 20\%~\cite{googlestats}. Amazon also found that every 100ms of delay on their website costs them 1\% in sales~\cite{amazonstats}. This highlights just how important it is for users to have an experience that is as smooth as possible, and how important it is for large companies to use high performance software which takes full advantage of the hardware capabilities. Therefore, it is in the best interests of both users and website operators to push for the introduction of technological advancements such as HTTP/2 which was designed to address some of the performance issues that are present in previous iterations of the protocol.
