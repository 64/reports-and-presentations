abstract = {A basic fact in spectral graph theory is that the number of connected components in an undirected graph is equal to the multiplicity of the eigenvalue zero in the Laplacian matrix of the graph. In particular, the graph is disconnected if and only if there are at least two eigenvalues equal to zero. Cheeger's inequality and its variants provide an approximate version of the latter fact; they state that a graph has a sparse cut if and only if there are at least two eigenvalues that are close to zero.It has been conjectured that an analogous characterization holds for higher multiplicities: There are k eigenvalues close to zero if and only if the vertex set can be partitioned into k subsets, each defining a sparse cut. We resolve this conjecture positively. Our result provides a theoretical justification for clustering algorithms that use the bottom k eigenvectors to embed the vertices into Rk, and then apply geometric considerations to the embedding.We also show that these techniques yield a nearly optimal quantitative connection between the expansion of sets of size ≈ n/k and λk, the kth smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian, where n is the number of vertices. In particular, we show that in every graph there are at least k/2 disjoint sets (one of which will have size at most 2n/k), each having expansion at most O(√λk log k). Louis, Raghavendra, Tetali, and Vempala have independently proved a slightly weaker version of this last result. The √log k bound is tight, up to constant factors, for the “noisy hypercube” graphs.},

abstract = {Let φ(G) be the minimum conductance of an undirected graph G, and let 0=λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ ... ≤ λn ≤ 2 be the eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian matrix of G. We prove that for any graph G and any k ≥ 2, [φ(G) = O(k) l2/√lk,] and this performance guarantee is achieved by the spectral partitioning algorithm. This improves Cheeger's inequality, and the bound is optimal up to a constant factor for any $k$. Our result shows that the spectral partitioning algorithm is a constant factor approximation algorithm for finding a sparse cut if lk is a constant for some constant k. This provides some theoretical justification to its empirical performance in image segmentation and clustering problems. We extend the analysis to spectral algorithms for other graph partitioning problems, including multi-way partition, balanced separator, and maximum cut.},

abstract = {A general method for obtaining asymptotic isoperimetric inequalities for families of graphs is developed. Some of these inequalities have been applied to functional analysis. This method uses the second smallest eigenvalue of a certain matrix associated with the graph and it is the discrete version of a method used before for Riemannian manifolds. Also some results are obtained on spectra of graphs that show how this eigenvalue is related to the structure of the graph. Combining these results with some known results on group representations many new examples are constructed explicitly of linear sized expanders and superconcentrators.}

abstract = {We introduce an algorithm for unsupervised co-segmentation of a set of shapes so as to reveal the semantic shape parts and establish their correspondence across the set. The input set may exhibit significant shape variability where the shapes do not admit proper spatial alignment and the corresponding parts in any pair of shapes may be geometrically dissimilar. Our algorithm can handle such challenging input sets since, first, we perform co-analysis in a descriptor space, where a combination of shape descriptors relates the parts independently of their pose, location, and cardinality. Secondly, we exploit a key enabling feature of the input set, namely, dissimilar parts may be "linked" through third-parties present in the set. The links are derived from the pairwise similarities between the parts' descriptors. To reveal such linkages, which may manifest themselves as anisotropic and non-linear structures in the descriptor space, we perform spectral clustering with the aid of diffusion maps. We show that with our approach, we are able to co-segment sets of shapes that possess significant variability, achieving results that are close to those of a supervised approach.},
